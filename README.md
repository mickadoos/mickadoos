[DPlan](https://famous-brioche-240d75.netlify.app/) is a **Full Stack application** meant to help users plannify their private events such as parties or social meetings in a simple way. Organizing plans has never been so easy!

Developed in 5 days at Ironhack with two more colleagues using React, **Javascript, Node.js, Express & MongoDB**. (check the Frontend repo [here](https://github.com/PmplCode/DPlan-front) and the Backend repo [here](https://github.com/PmplCode/DPlan-back))
